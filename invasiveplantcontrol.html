        <h2>What Are Invasive Plants?</h2>
        <p>
          Invasive Exotic Pest Plants are plants that have been introduced into our region from other areas. 
          They have aggressive growing characteristics that threaten the survival of our own native plants 
          and animals. In their native regions, climate, animals, and disease organisms kept their growth 
          in check. Here, they have not experienced those factors and have flourished so well they are 
          choking out native plants that have carefully evolved with their specialized birds, bees, 
          butterflies, insect pollinators, etc. to create balanced and biologically diverse ecosystems. 
          The spread of invasive exotic pest plants has become a multi-billion dollar problem in the U.S. 
          and is the second greatest factor contributing to the loss of biodiversity following habitat destruction.
